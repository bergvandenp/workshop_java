#Workshop java

##Working on the assignments
Assignments are divided in seperate branches. Those branches are based on each other in the following order

1. setup
2. jsf
3. persistence
4. jax-rs
5. jax-ws
6. streaming

Each branch contains a README.md file that describes the assignment. The branch also contains code that is the solution of the assignment, which can be evaluated when you are stuck.
